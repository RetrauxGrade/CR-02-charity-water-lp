        Amina used to walk miles twice every day to collect water for her family. It took so much time, she did not have time to go to school. She would come back with the biggest jerry can she can carry, filled with the only thing available after her long trek: dirty, diseased water. Thanks to your support, her village now has a clean water well, available for everyone in her community. Amina can go to school and her family is healthier and happier. As you can see, clean water changed everything.
